To help me with my trip planning, I need to do some climate analysis on this area. Alright, Let's set some objective,*### Objectives- Perform Climate Analysis, - Create a climate app- Bonus - Temperature Analysis and Calculate Daily Rainfall average## Analysis and Observation### Step 1 - Climate Analysis and Exploration- Use Python and SQLAlchemy to do basic climate analysis and data exploration of your climate database. - Analysis must be completed using SQLAlchemy ORM queries, Pandas, and Matplotlib.	* Use SQLAlchemy `create_engine` to connect to your sqlite database.	* Use SQLAlchemy `automap_base()` to reflect your tables into classes and save a reference 	   to those classes called `Station` and `Measurement`.	* Link Python to the database by creating an SQLAlchemy session.	* **Important** Don't forget to close out your session at the end of your notebook.### 1. Precipitation Analysis - Start by finding the most recent date in the data set.- Using this date, retrieve the last 12 months of precipitation data by querying the 12 preceding months of data. **Note** you do not pass in the date as a variable to your query.* Select only the `date` and `prcp` values.* Load the query results into a Pandas DataFrame and set the index to the date column.* Sort the DataFrame values by `date`.* Plot the results using the DataFrame `plot` method.* Use Pandas to print the summary statistics for the precipitation data.![Precipitation Analysis](./Images/precipitaion_plot.png) ### 2. Station Analysis* Design a query to calculate the total number of stations in the dataset.* Design a query to find the most active stations (i.e. which stations have the most rows?).  * List the stations and observation counts in descending order.  * Which station id has the highest number of observations?  * Using the most active station id, calculate the lowest, highest, and average temperature.* Design a query to retrieve the last 12 months of temperature observation data (TOBS).  * Filter by the station with the highest number of observations.  * Query the last 12 months of temperature observation data for this station.  * Plot the results as a histogram with `bins=12`* Close out your session.![Station Analysis](./Images/histogram.png) - - -## Step 2 - Climate AppBased on the initial analysis, design a Flask API based on the queries that you have just developed.* Use Flask to create your routes.### Routes* `/`- Home page.- List all routes that are available.![Welcome Page](./Images/API-alchemy.jpg) * `/api/v1.0/precipitation`- Return a list of Measurement data ie, Date, and Precipitation of each Measuremen in the form of Dictionary.![Precipitation API](./Images/precipitaion-api.jpg)   * `/api/v1.0/stations`- Return a JSON list of stations from the dataset.![Station API](./Images/station_api.jpg) * `/api/v1.0/tobs`- Return a JSON list of temperature observations (TOBS) for the previous year.![TOBS API](./Images/tobs_api.jpg) * `/api/v1.0/<start>` and `/api/v1.0/<start>/<end>`-  Return a JSON list of the minimum temperature, the average temperature, and the max temperature for a given start or start-end range.Eg Date: 2010-02-20/2016-02-20![Start-End Dates API](./Images/start_end_dates.jpg) - - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------## Bonus: Other Recommended Analyses### Temperature Analysis I* Hawaii is reputed to enjoy mild weather all year. Is there a meaningful difference between the temperature in, for example, June and December?* Use the t-test to determine whether the difference in the means, if any, is statistically significant. Will you use a paired t-test, or an unpaired t-test? Why?![Bonus 1](./Images/Bonus1-analysis.jpg) ### Temperature Analysis II-  Using historical data in the dataset find out what the temperature has previously looked like between August first to August seventh.- Use the `calc_temps` function to calculate the min, avg, and max temperatures for your trip using the matching dates from a previous year (i.e., use "2017-08-01").![Temp Analysis 1](./Images/Temperature_Analysis_I.png) ### Daily Rainfall Average* check to see what the rainfall has been, you don't want a when it rains the whole time!* Calculate the rainfall per weather station using the previous year's matching dates and the daily normals.   ![Temp Analysis 2](Images/Temperature_Analysis_II.png)## Technologies and Tools* git Bash* Jupyter notebook* VS Code Editor* Chrome Browser### Python Modules and libraries* pandas * sql alchemy* alchemy flask* matplotlib.pyplot* numpy### Database* SQLite## Code - [Climate Analysis](/climate_starter.ipynb)- [Temperature Analysis I ](/temp_analysis_bonus_1_starter.ipynb)- [Temperature Analysis II ](/temp_analysis_bonus_2_starter.ipynb)- [API Script](/app.py)## StatusProject completed## Acknowledgement - Homework discussion with Courtney Gomez- Trilogy Education Services Â© 2020.## ContactCreated by [Divyashettyk@gmail.com](#divyashettyk@gmail.com)
